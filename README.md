Hello world exercises for WebGL

## Scene 1
### Create a scene with a single triangle.
- [x] The triangle should be centered in camera/clip space, with a side length of 0.6.
- [x] It should have one red corner, one blue corner, and one green corner, and interpolate color between them.
- [x] The scene must utilize an ortholinear projection matrix.
- [x] Try moving the triangle and the projection matrix together and separately.

## Scene 2
### Create a scene with a single triangle with perspective view.
- [x] Recreate scene 1 with a perspective projection matrix.

## Scene 3
### Create a scene with a rotating cube.
- [x] The scene must utilize a perspective projection matrix.
- [x] No lighting or shadows are required.
- [x] Each face of the cube must be a different color.

## Scene 4
### Create a scene with a rotating cube, a single light, and a plane.
- [x] This scene should demonstrate simple diffuse lighting.
- [x] This scene should not display shadows.
- [x] The cube should have the same material for all faces.

## Scene 5
### Create a scene with a rotating cube, a single light, and a plane.
- [x] This scene should demonstrate simple diffuse lighting.
- [x] The scene should demonstrate phong lighting (interpolated normals).
- [x] The plane should be texture mapped.
- [x] The scene should display accurate shadows via shadow mapping.

## Scene 6
### Create a scene with bunny.obj and a plane and a single light.
- [ ] This scene should read the bunny model in from a file.
- [ ] The scene should demonstrate phong lighting (interpolated normals).
- [ ] The scene should have accurate shadows via shadow mapping.
- [ ] The plane should be texture mapped.

## Scene 7 (stretch goal)
### Create a scene with bunny.obj, a plane, and 2 lights
- [ ] This scene should have 2 lights.
- [ ] The scene should have accurate shadows via shadow mapping.
- [ ] The plane should be texture mapped.
